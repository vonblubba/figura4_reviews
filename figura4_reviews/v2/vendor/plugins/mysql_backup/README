MySQL Database Backup Plugin

What does it do?
====================================

A simple backup plugin for backing up mysql databases and compressing them on linux systems.

It uses mysqldump and tar to create and compress the backups. Details of the backup are then saved into
a 'database_backups' table which contains the filename, path and file size as well as the date created.

Install Instructions
====================================

1) Install the plguin
   ./script/plugin install http://svn.atechmedia.com/railsbits/plugins/mysql_backup

2) Run the included database migration generator
   ./script/generate database_backup_migration
   
3) Run db:migrate to create the database_backups table
   rake db:migrate
   
4) Set your backup path, whether you want the files compressed and your file prefix in config/backup.yml

5) Try and backup using the included rake task
   rake db:backup
   

Notes
====================================

 - You can also run a backup by running 'AtechMedia::Backup.now' from anywhere in your Rails app or
   through ./script/console
